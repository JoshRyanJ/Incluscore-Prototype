# Incluscore-Prototype
Prototype app exploring data analytics for digital inclusion with scoring framework, dashboards, and survey integration.
# InkluScore Prototype  

This is a beginner-friendly prototype I built to explore **digital inclusion**.  
The goal is to see how online platforms in Ghana (and beyond) measure up on **accessibility, privacy, usability, and child safety**.  

## What it does
- Upload a CSV with sample scores  
- The app calculates a **weighted inclusion score (0–100)**  
- Shows results in a **dashboard-style view** with charts and tables  
- Lets you download the scored results for further analysis  
- Includes a very simple survey experiment to connect user feedback with the scoring system  

## Why I built it
I wanted to practice:
- **Data handling** (normalizing scores, applying weights)  
- **Visualization** (turning raw numbers into easy-to-read charts)  
- **User-centered design** (thinking about surveys and feedback loops)  

## Tech stack
- Python (Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly)  
- Simple CSV data to keep it light and understandable  

## What’s next
- Add more accessibility metrics (like WCAG checks)  
- Improve the dashboard design  
- Explore using a simple ML model for risk flags

This is just a **prototype**, but it reflects my interest in digital inclusion, data storytelling, and building tools that can have real-world impact.
